## Overview

I Bet You Screw Up (IBYSU) is a promise-keeping/bet-making app in which users can make promises which other users can bet on. Users have the ability to create an account, make promises, bet on promises, and follow other users. When a promise a user has bet on has been validated or expires, the user receives a notification and loses or gains the appropriate amount of points. Users each have a ranking which depends on how many promises they have kept and how many promises they have broken. This ranking determines the number of points a user can win when betting on that users promise. For example, if a user has broken the majority of their promises and another user bets they will keep a promise, that user will have a higher return on their bet should the promise-maker keep their promise. 

## Development

IBYSU was developed using Sinatra as a web application framework and Bourbon as a SASS framework. It also utilizes Javascript/JQUERY to perform AJAX requests to improve UI/UX and reduce the number of page reloads required for the app.
